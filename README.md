## 📚 Currently Learning  

I’m committed to expanding my skills beyond my diploma through **self-directed learning and practical application**.  
Right now, I’m actively:  

- **Mastering React.js** to build fast, interactive single-page applications with reusable components.  
- **Diving deeper into Django** with advanced class-based views, DRF patterns, and scalable architecture.  
- **Practising Unit Testing & TDD** to deliver more reliable, maintainable code.  
- Exploring **modern web performance optimisation** techniques for faster load times and better SEO.  

> My approach: learn by building — every new concept gets applied to a real mini-project or feature.

*Note: My commit history is inconsistent while completing my diploma. This is because I have studied this course while being full-time self-employed — the focus was shipping complete, well-documented projects in solid increments when I had time booked off.*
